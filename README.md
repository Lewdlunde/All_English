# All_English
This code will grab the 6-digit number of every English result from NH

It will copy all the numbers to 16 .txt files (to prevent too much data in one file, due to duplicate numbers).

You must edit the number on line 155 to the current ammount of pages for the English search result on Nhentai, plus 1, if you want the code to print 'done' when it is actually done.
