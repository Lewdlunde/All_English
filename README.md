# All_English
This code will grab the 6-digit number of every English result from NH
It will print all the numbers for you to copy.
You must edit the number on line 57 to the current ammount of pages for the English search result on Nhentai, plus 1
This is stupid, but Nhentai will allow you to go several pages beyond what actually exists. I may fix this with a way to detect this in the future, but I'm pretty content with this.
